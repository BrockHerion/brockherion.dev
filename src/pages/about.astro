      <p class="text-xl mb-4">
        I've been interested in computers and programming for as long as I can
        remember. A large part of that was growing up playing games like Star
        Wars: Battlefront, Minecraft, and Skyrim. One of my earliest memories
        was looking up a tutorial on how to build a blog and watching a video on
        Ruby on Rails. I was probably about nine or ten at the time.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl mb-4">
        My first project I ever did was eigth grade, where I made a top-down
        shooter in Scratch. It was all drag and drop, but it was my first
        exposure to logic and conditionals. After that, I grew an interest in
        iOS but never did anything with it. I instead pursued hardware and
        building my own PC's.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl mb-4">
        I took in Java high school. I then pursued game development, learning
        Unity and C#. Still itching to build websites, I took a Web Design and
        JavaScript course in college. Disatissfied with it, I taught myself
        modern JavaScript, TypeScript, and picked up Angular for building web
        apps. I also focused on Java, C#, and Python for building backends for
        my applications.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl mb-4">
        My current stack revolves around building applications to be fast,
        robust, and scalable. I use C# on the backend for work, but use Next.JS
        for pretty much everything else. I deploy my apps to Vercel. For
        databases, I tend to lean on Supabase or Planetscale depending on what
        kind of application I'm building. I enjoy solving problems, not fighting
        with the tools and technology that are supposed to help me solve them.

        I'm currently living in the Chicago suburbs with my fiance and our three
        cats. Together, we share our love of Disney, coffee, and over-the-top
        dramatic TV shows. We love taking trips and getting to travel with each
        other. Our wedding is June 4th, 2022 and we couldn't be more excited!
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl mb-4">
        Besides programming, my own hobbies include reading and writing I love
        writing in my journal, studying various technologies, writing blog
        posts, and crafting short stories. I enjoy reading science fiction books
        like Dune and Foundation, but also like books on startups, finance, and
        personal growth.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl mb-4">
        When I have time, I still really enjoy gaming, specifically Minecraft. I
        love getting servers setup to play with my friends and just letting my
        creativity flow. I was also into creating texture packs and mods, but
        haven't done that in a long time. Sometimes, I'll play on modded
        servers, which lets me push the boundaries of creativity even further.
