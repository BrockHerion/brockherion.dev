I've been using Next.js for almost three years now. I've taken multiple applications, both for personal projects and for work, to production with it. Today, I wanted to share why I use Next and why I will continue using it for the foreseeable future.

## TL;DW

- I've been using Next.js for almost three years now
- I can build and ship applications quickly
- I'm more comfortable using JSX than other libraries like Angular or Vue
- Switching to Nuxt or SvelteKit would hurt my productivity
- There's a large ecosystem of libraries and tools available
- I can deploy to a number of platforms without having to deal with infrastructure - including Vercel
- My backend and frontend are within a single codebase, no need to maintain two separate codebases/apps
- I have multiple options for handling data fetching
- My entire codebase is a single language and using TypeScript gives me end-to-end type-safety
